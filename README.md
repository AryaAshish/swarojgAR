we presentedd this idea in Rajasthan hackathon 4.0 on the subject women financial empowerment.
Talking About Financial Empowerment we can’t directly distribute money to women for lifetime. 
So we can empower them by providing them with a job opportunity. 
Once a person has job security he/she is capable enough to fight against all the odds. 
So, what we can do is provide them a platform that provides them with a job security.

We can create a forum where women can login to find jobs. It’s not a like any other job portal what we goanna do is that we would create a platform where a group of women can come together to create a business out of none.

We would take ideas from them for business and then provide them with some funds to make their idea a success. And those with no idea can add to them as laborer. In this way we can provide them with job security. This would help them to be financially empowered.

 Now coming up with providing funds we can create a forum where people who want to help can contribute for the good cause. This would also awareness among the people for the good cause.

Now coming on how to implement it, we can create a page where women from all background can approach and easily access it. Those women can provide their idea for a business or some sort of small scale workshop they want to setup. And those who have no idea can be hired from other women for their business as employee.

On the other hand, we can provide with other user interface where people who want to help can contribute to the cause. We can provide them with 2 options i.e. either they can provide with a loan or with a selfless service funds. This would help them to get more money as none of them would be able to give that large amount of fund. So by this we can get to fulfill our set of goals.

By this way we can aid the women of some financial help which will surely help her to get empowered. Once a person is financially strong he/she is able to face all the problems which may interrupt her in her way of success.

 

Now coming to Political empowerment: - We can create a platform where we get to spread all the knowledge related to recent amendments in law. And the current policies related government.

We can create a platform where women can raise their voices against the injustice and can get justice. We can also create platform where they can get polls done for certain policies or against certain decision. In this way we can get their voices to reach the upper level of governance.
